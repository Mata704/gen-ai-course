"""A small persistent memory store for agents (Session 4 onwards).

This is supplied storage, not a memory policy. It stores records in a SQLite
file and offers basic queries. What is written, by whom, with which
confidence, how conflicts are resolved and what is returned to the model is
decided by the harness.

A record:

    memory_id     unique id (MEM-0001, ...)
    kind          free text, e.g. known_issue, incident_summary, shift_note, procedure
    subject       usually a component name, e.g. order-gateway
    content       the text of the memory
    source_type   who or what produced it: user | agent | tool | document
    source_ref    where it came from (ticket key, run id, log ref, user name)
    author        identity that wrote it
    team          isolation scope: records are only visible to the same team
    created_at    simulated date and time, e.g. "2026-11-04 10:05"
    valid_until   optional date and time after which the record is stale
    confidence    0.0 to 1.0, set by the writer
    status        active | superseded
    supersedes    memory_id of the record this one corrects, if any

Deleting a record removes its content. Only the id, the time and the reason
are kept in a deletion log, so a deletion can be audited without keeping the
deleted information.
