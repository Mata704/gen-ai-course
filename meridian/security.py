"""Facts a security policy needs about an action (Session 5 onwards).

This module does not decide anything. It collects, deterministically and
outside the model, the facts an authorization policy needs: who is acting,
on what, whether the target is critical, whether the trading session is open
and which approval (if any) backs the request. The policy itself (RBAC,
freeze rules, approval requirements) is written in the harness.

    request = describe_action(ctx.deps, "rollback_change", "CHG-4471", confirmation_ref)
    if request.critical and request.trading_session and request.approver_role != "incident-manager":
        return {"status": "refused", "reason": "..."}
